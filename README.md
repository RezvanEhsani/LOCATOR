# LOCATOR: anaLysis Of CAncer Tissue micrOenviRonment

We developed a novel computational method, LOCATOR (anaLysis Of CAncer Tissue micrOenviRonment), for spatial analysis of cancer microenvironments using data acquired from mass cytometry imaging (MCI) technologies.  LOCATOR introduces a graph-based representation of tissue images to describe features of the cellular organisation and deploys downstream analysis and visualisation utilities that can be used for data-driven patient risk stratification. Our case study using MCI data from two well-annotated breast cancer cohorts re-confirmed that the spatial organisation of the tumour-immune microenvironment is strongly associated with the clinical outcome in breast cancer. In addition, we report interesting potential associations between the cellular organization of macrophages and patientsâ€™ survival.  Our work introduces an automated and versatile analysis framework for MCI data with many applications in future cancer research projects.

# LOCATOR's functions

Before using LOCATOR's functions, some parameters setting are required. Please see the Example.R code in Codes directory for more information. 

Feature matrix can be extracted by:

` > FeatureData <- Extract_Features(Data = MainData)`

The files and plots can be made by main function:

```
> OutPuts <- TIMEClust(FeatureData = FeatureData, 
                       MainData = MainData,
                       SurvivalData = SurvivalData,
                       Cutoff = 'Mean')
```
           
# Example
An example can be found in Codes directory and Example.R file. All returned plots can be found in Keren_Plots directory. The example is for Macrophages as cells of interest from Keren et al. paper:
